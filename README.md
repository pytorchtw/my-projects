# My Projects

The following is a list of my side projects that I try to create and experiment with when learning something new

- [go-json-server](https://github.com/pytorchtw/go-json-server)
    + simple Go JSON server that returns json responses like those from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
    
- [go-batch-crawler](https://github.com/pytorchtw/go-batch-crawler)
    + Go batch crawler that crawls a given list of urls

- [go-json-rest-starter](https://github.com/pytorchtw/go-json-rest-starter)
    + simple demo of json rest server
    + 1 click run with docker-compose
    + graceful server shutdown code
